# Project Overview

## Problem Being Solved
The agricultural industry in Saskatchewan is a significant contributor to the economy, and optimizing crop production is essential for sustaining growth and profitability. This project aims to address these challenges by utilizing rural manucipality crop yeilds and Geographic Information System (GIS) datas, and machine learning techniques to identify the optimal rural municipality in Saskatchewan for flax investment and to propose suitable crop rotation plans.

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to leverage GIS data and machine learning models to provide actionable insights for farmers and investors in Saskatchewan. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. **Identify the Best Rural Municipality for Flax Investment**: Using crop yeilds and GIS datas to analyze historical crop yields, the project seeks to pinpoint the rural municipality in Saskatchewan that offers the most favorable farms for flax cultivation.

2. **Determine Optimal Crop Rotation Strategies**: To ensure sustainable agricultural practices and enhance soil health, the project will explore different crop rotation options that can be integrated with flax farming.

## Questions Being Answered
To achieve the above objectives, the project will answer the following key questions:

1. **Where is the Best Rural Municipality in Saskatchewan to Invest in Flax?**

2. **What Crop Rotation Can We Consider for Flax Farming?**


## Methodology
To answer these questions, the project employs two machine learning models: unsupervised spectral clustering and K-means clustering.

1. **Unsupervised Spectral Clustering**

2. **K-means Clustering**

By combining these two clustering techniques, the project provides a comprehensive analysis of the rural municipalities in Saskatchewan, offering a clear recommendations for flax investment and sustainable crop rotation practices.
